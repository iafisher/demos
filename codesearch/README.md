A simple indexed search engine for code. Inspired by ["Regular Expression Matching with a Trigram Index" by Russ Cox](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html).

TODO:

- Don't assume UTF-8
- More efficient index file format
- Trigrams instead of variable-length words
- Simple regular expressions
- Boolean search operators
