Miscellaneous projects that are too small for their own repositories, but that I still want to track with git and share publicly.

Demos:

- `dynlib`: Dynamically load shared libraries on Linux.
- `fileupload`: Upload files from the web with a progress bar using JavaScript.

Games:

- `boggle`: A console implementation of Boggle.
- `connect4`: A console implementation of Connect Four.
